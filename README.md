Storyteller Pagination enables you to create "endless" pagination by appending the contents of the next page in a set to the current one. It will asynchronously request the contents of the next page, filter them, and cache them until the "next" button is clicked.

### Usage

In order to use Storyteller Pagination, your page needs to be capable of loading dynamic content using a URL parameter (like `/page/5`, `?p=5`, or `?skip=25`). In your markup, you need a container with an id (`#content` in this case), an element containing paginated elements (`.st-items`), and a next button (`.st-next`).

```html
<div id="content" class="st-pagination" data-url="/page/:p">
	<ul class="st-items">
		<!-- Your rendering loop should be here -->
		<li><!-- Your content in here --></li>
	</ul>
	<a class="st-next" href="#next">Next</a>
</div>
```

This markup is the bare minumum necessary for Storyteller Pagination to work. **An id is required on the pagination div**. Please note that the "next" link does not necessarily need to be an `<a>`, it just needs the `st-next` class. From here, you can add basically any markup you want!

```html
<div id="content" class="st-pagination" data-url="/page/:p">
	<h1>My YouTube Favorites</h1>
	<sub>A list of my favorite videos from all across YouTube!</sub>
	<a class="st-next" href="#next">Next</a>
	<ul class="st-items">
		{{#favorites}}
		<li>
			<h4>{{title}}</h4>
			<img src="{{thumbnail}}" />
			<var class="duration">{{duration}}</var>
			<em class="author">{{author}}</em>
			<p class="description">{{description}}</p>
			<a href="{{link}}">Watch Now!</a>
		</li>
		{{/favorites}}
	</ul>
	<a class="st-next" href="#next">Next</a>
</div>
```

The code to start the plugin will also need to be run:

```javascript
$(function(){
	
	$('.st-pagination').stPagination();

});
```

### Configuration

**Configuration options can be set in two ways:** through `data` attributes on the parent `.st-pagination` element, or with a configuration object passed directly to the plugin.

* **url** ( default "?p=:p" ) - The URL for the next page in the set, replacing the page number with ":p"
* **type** ( default "page" ) - Determines the type of pagination--can be `page`, for APIs that use page numbers, or `skip`, for APIs that skip a certain number of results.
* **start** ( default "1" ) - What page/item number to start paginating from.
* **selectors** - An object of selector names and selector strings. `next` is the selector for the 'next' button, `items` is the selector for the container which items are appended to, and `item` is the selector for individual items. If you define these, classes like `st-next` and `st-items` are no longer mandatory (as your selectors will be used instead).

```html
<!-- Configuring a "skip" paginator with a default skip start -->
<div id="content" class="st-pagination" data-url="start=:p" data-type="skip" data-start="25">
```

```javascript
// Configuring a "page" paginator with a default page start
$('#content').stPagination({
	url: '?page=:p',
	type: 'page',
	start: 1
});
```

### Events

Storyteller Pagination makes some events available for better integration. The events are as follows:

* **next** ( event, element ) - Fires when the 'next' method is triggered, either by a user click or manually.
* **complete** ( event, element ) - Fires when the next page no longer returns results and the next button is disabled.

These events can be bound in two ways: with an `events` object in the `stPagination()` configuration object, or with jQuery's normal event bindings.

```javascript
// Binding inside the configuration object
$('.st-pagination').stPagination({
	events: {
		next: function( event, element ){ console.log( 'next', event, element ); },
		complete: function( event, element ){ console.log( 'complete', event, element ); }
	}
});

// Binding with normal events
$('.st-pagination').on({
	next: function( event, element ){ console.log( 'next', event, element ); },
	complete: function( event, element ){ console.log( 'complete', event, element ); }
});
```

*Events cannot be bound using `data` attributes.
